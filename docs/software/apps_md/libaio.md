# libaio

[Back to application catalog](/software/app_catalog/)

## Description

Linux native Asynchronous I/O interface library.  AIO enables even a single application thread to overlap I/O operations with other processing, by providing an interface for submitting one or more I/O requests in one system call (io_submit()) without waiting for completion, and a separate interface (io_getevents()) to reap completed I/O operations associated with a given completion group.
