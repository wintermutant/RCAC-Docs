## Description

Quantum ESPRESSO (Quantum opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization) is an integrated suite of open-source computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is based on density functional theory, plane-wave basis sets, and pseudopotentials. Quantum ESPRESSO supports advanced simulations of solid-state materials, surfaces, and nanostructures, and is widely used in condensed matter physics, materials science, and quantum chemistry research.
