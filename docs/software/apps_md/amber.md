## Description

Amber is a suite of biomolecular simulation programs together with Amber tools.  A manual download is required for Ambers. Spack will search your current directory for the download files. Alternatively, add the files to a mirror so that Spack can find them. For instructions on how to set up a mirror, see https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mirrors.html  Note: Only certain versions of ambertools are compatible with amber. Only the latter version of ambertools for each amber version is supported.
