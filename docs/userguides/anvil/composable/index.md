New usage patterns have emerged in research computing that depend on the availability of custom services such as notebooks, databases, elastic software stacks, and science gateways alongside traditional batch HPC. The Anvil Composable Subsystem is a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) based private cloud managed with [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) that provides a platform for creating composable infrastructure on demand. This cloud-style flexibility provides researchers the ability to self-deploy and manage persistent services to complement HPC workflows and run container-based data analysis tools and applications.
